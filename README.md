## Global Sales Data Analytics

### Abstract

Due to the proliferation of information in daily life, data is being produced at an extremely quick rate. Numerous organisations produce vast amounts of data that are challenging to evaluate and utilise. Huge data are produced by an increasing number of environmental sensors, including satellites and traffic cameras, internet activity on social networking sites, healthcare databases, government databases, sales data, etc. It is difficult to process, analyse, and communicate this data. Every day, huge amounts of sales data are poured onto online purchasing platforms. It is challenging to analyse and visualise this data for information retrieval. Consequently, a system that can efficiently analyse and visualise data is needed.
